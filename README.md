## üöÄ Current Projects
- **Outlook Business Insights Extractor**:  
   Automating the extraction of actionable insights from Outlook emails using the Microsoft Graph API. This application processes email metadata, downloads attachments, and exports structured data to Excel for enhanced business decision-making.

- **Factory Sensor (AlertWorks)**:   
  Automated end-to-end demo project showcasing how to build a real-time IoT streaming pipeline with Azure and open-source tools. It simulates machines sending telemetry, processes hot-alert events in the cloud, stores alerts in Blob Storage, visualizes data in a Streamlit dashboard, automates notifications with Power Automate, and enables executive reporting via Power BI.

- **F**:
   Football Analytica is an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that transforms raw match footage into actionable insights. Leveraging YOLOv8 for ultra-fast object detection, it automatically detects and tracks players, referees, and the ball; assigns players to teams via K-means jersey-color clustering; compensates for camera motion with optical flow; and applies perspective transformation to convert pixel data into real-world metrics. The result? Detailed analytics‚Äîsuch as ball-possession percentages, player speed, and distance covered‚Äîready to inform pre-match tactics, in-game strategy, and post-match analysis for coaches, analysts, and fans alike.
